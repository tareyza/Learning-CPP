Symbolic constants allow for more clear meaning within code. Symbol constants are referred to by their name, such as CLASS_SIZE or ROW_NUM and as a result anyone reading the code clearly knows what the code is referring to. Further, modifying symbolic constants requires only changing the code in one location, whereas literal constants must be redefined everywhere they are written. Using #defined is not recommended because they might have name conflicts and are not seen in the debugging.
